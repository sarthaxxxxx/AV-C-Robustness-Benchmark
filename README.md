## AV2C Dataset
We release the AV2C (Audio-Visual 2 Corruptions) dataset to supplement our work. `avc2_dataset.py` contains the dataset which takes any audio-visual datasets and adds any of the corruptions at any severity level that we released. The file is modular, allowing anyone to modify it for their datasets and their models. `/corruptions` contains the code for each of the corruptions, their severity levels, the images to create corrupted images, and the audio to create corrupted audios. 

### Setting up the current dataset
To begin, you will be required to create a `json` file for your dataset containing its wav path, labels, video ID, and video path. For example, `BkjpjAohg-0` is the video ID for a file `BkjpjAohg-0.mp4`. The video path is the directory containing the frames for the video ID. As an example

```
{
    "data": [
        {
            "wav": "/home/adrian/Data/AudioSet/eval_audio/BkjpjAohg-0.wav",
            "labels": "/m/04rlf,/m/07pjwq1,/m/07s72n,/m/08cyft",
            "video_id": "BkjpjAohg-0",
            "video_path": "/home/adrian/Data/AudioSet/eval_frames"
        },
        {
            "wav": "/home/adrian/Data/AudioSet/eval_audio/4ufZrEAJnJI.wav",
            "labels": "/m/0242l",
            "video_id": "4ufZrEAJnJI",
            "video_path": "/home/adrian/Data/AudioSet/eval_frames"
        }, ...
